# Cinderblock + .kit
Forked from https://github.com/dhgamache/Cinderblock to be a little bit more comfortable for my personal needs.

## Changes
- Setup to use the simple tempting language .kit (http://incident57.com/codekit/kit.php)
- Includes SCSS and a compiled.scss file which is how I like to roll my css
- Formatting changes
- Including a local copy of jQuery for coding offline
- Renames app.'s to functions.js, not a big deal, but its a little bit more descriptive, yet generic.

## Why?
I think I've downloaded Dave's repo about a billion times, it's the best. Yet, every time I make these or similar changes. So, why the hell not fork it?
